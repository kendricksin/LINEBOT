Here I am building a chatbot integrated with Line and Gemini

You need to run this with a API gateway such as ngrok to expose a HTTPS webhook

Couple of other settings include creating line official account, line developer account, and other backend settings which can be found here: https://developers.line.biz/en/services/messaging-api/
